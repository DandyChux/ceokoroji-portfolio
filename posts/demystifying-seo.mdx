## What is SEO, and Why Should I Care?

So, if you've got a website (and let's face it, who doesn't these days?), you want Google to think you're the bee's knees. That's where SEO comes in.

## Keywords: The Magic Words

Keywords are like the secret handshake of of the SEO club. They're the words and phrases that people type into search engines when they're looking for something. If you want Google to recommend your site, you need to use the right keywords. 

But don't just stuff your website with keywords like a Thanksgiving turkey. Google's smarter than that. You need to use your keywords naturally and strategically.

Local SEO focuses on optimizing your website to be found by people in your area. This includes strategies like claiming your Google My Business listing, optimizing for local keywords (like "best pizza in Brooklyn"), and collecting local reviews.

## Quality Content: More than Buzzwords

Ever been to a party where someone just won't stop talking about themselves? Don't be that guy. Google rewards websites that provide valuable, relevant content to their users. So, think about what your customers want and need, and then give it to them. It's that simple!

It tells Google that you're trustworthy and relevant. But beware of shady shortcuts. Quality over quantity is the golden rule when it comes to backlinks.
